## Underfit
High SSE, low attention, low variance

## Overfit
Low SSE, high attention, high variance

## Curse of dimensionality
Amount of data required to generalize accurately grows exponentially as number of features (dimensions)

### kNN
You need 10 points in 1D to generalize effectively. 100 in 2D ...
